                    <h1 id="basic-information">Basic Information:</h1>
                    <p>Loggerhead sea turtles, with their large, robust shells, are predominantly found in tropical
                        waters
                        of the
                        Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These highly migratory creatures travel an average
                        distance of
                        7,500 miles
                        between their breeding beaches and hunting grounds. While they breed on land, loggerhead sea
                        turtles
                        spend the
                        majority of their time submerged in water. Presently, their population in the wild stands at
                        approximately
                        200,000 individuals.</p>
                    <h1 id="endangerment">Endangerment:</h1>
                    <p>The endangerment of loggerhead sea turtles stems from various factors. Accidental entanglement in
                        fishing gears
                        and nets leads to their demise, while human hunting targets them for their meat, skin, and
                        shells.
                        Ocean
                        pollution and marine debris contribute significantly to their deaths, as ingestion of plastic
                        mistaken for food
                        results in suffocation. Reproduction is challenging due to hatchling vulnerability to predators
                        such
                        as ghost
                        crabs, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and dogs. Climate change amplifies threats through higher sand
                        temperatures,
                        which can be lethal to turtle eggs. Rising seas and storm events cause beach erosion,
                        potentially
                        flooding or
                        washing away nests. Moreover, the instinct of hatchlings to seek the moon's light is confounded
                        by
                        coastal
                        development lights, leading them towards roads and perilous outcomes.</p>
                    <h1 id="existing-initiatives">Existing initiatives:</h1>
                    <p>Efforts to protect loggerhead sea turtles, an endangered species, have been undertaken by the
                        government. One
                        initiative is Nesting Beach Protection, which involves monitoring nesting beaches and
                        implementing
                        barriers to
                        safeguard their eggs from predators. In certain cases, nests are relocated to safer areas.
                        Another
                        measure is
                        the use of Turtle Excluder Devices, which selectively capture shrimp and fish while allowing
                        larger
                        marine life,
                        including loggerhead sea turtles, to escape as bycatch prevention. Marine Protected Areas,
                        legally
                        designated
                        ocean regions, serve as havens to shield marine life, including loggerhead sea turtles.</p>
                    <img class="media" src="assets/ted.jpg" alt="Turtle Excluder Device">
                    <h1 id="awareness-campaign-idea">Awareness Campaign Idea</h1>
                    <p>To address the various challenges faced by loggerhead sea turtles, a comprehensive approach could
                        involve a
                        combination of habitat and conservatory measures. One potential solution is the creation of a
                        3-D
                        habitat
                        structure that accommodates both their land-based and underwater needs. This structure could
                        feature
                        a split
                        design, with half situated on land and half underwater.</p>
                    <p>The underwater portion of the habitat could address the issue of accidental capture by fisheries.
                        By
                        incorporating Turtle Excluder Devices or similar mechanisms, the structure would help prevent
                        loggerhead sea
                        turtles from being unintentionally caught as bycatch.</p>
                    <p>The land-based section of the habitat would primarily focus on mitigating the impact of sea
                        debris on
                        the nesting
                        process. It could serve as a barrier to prevent debris from being washed ashore, thereby
                        facilitating successful
                        nesting for loggerhead turtles. This would also help protect newborn loggerheads from
                        entanglement
                        in the
                        debris, ensuring their safety and survival.</p>
                    <p>The urgency for such measures is highlighted by the decline in the loggerhead sea turtle
                        population.
                        Statistics
                        reveal a significant drop in loggerhead numbers in the wild, underscoring the need for immediate
                        conservation
                        efforts. By comparing the current living conditions of loggerhead turtles to the ideal
                        conditions
                        provided by
                        the proposed 3-D habitat structure, the importance of creating a safe and suitable environment
                        for
                        these
                        turtles, as well as other marine life, becomes evident.</p>
                    <h2 id="one-possible-solution-involving-ted">One Possible Solution Involving TED</h2>
                    <p>One potential solution to address the issue of ocean plastic pollution involves implementing a
                        payment system
                        based on the weight of plastic collected. This incentivizes individuals or organizations to
                        actively
                        participate
                        in cleaning up marine debris, including the majority of polyethylene plastics.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the collected plastic can be utilized to offset material costs for Turtle Excluder
                        Device (TED)
                        producers. By repurposing the collected plastic for manufacturing TEDs, the overall cost of
                        production can be
                        reduced, making these crucial devices more accessible and affordable.</p>
                    <p>Implementing such solutions not only helps combat plastic pollution but also creates employment
                        opportunities in
                        local areas. Job roles for trash collectors and TED manufacturers can be generated, fostering
                        economic growth
                        while addressing environmental concerns.</p>
                    <p>Considering the prevalence of polyethylene in ocean plastics, targeting this specific type of
                        plastic
                        for
                        collection and recycling efforts becomes crucial for effective mitigation of marine pollution.
                        By
                        focusing on
                        polyethylene, substantial progress can be made in reducing the overall impact of plastic waste
                        on
                        marine
                        ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>Limiting Factors are factors that place an upper limit on the size of the population. There are 6
                        main factors that are applicable to animals:
                    <p>
                    <ol>

                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Temperature:</b> Loggerhead sea turtles thrive when the temperature is above 22 degrees
                            celsius
                            in the water.</li>
                        <li><b>Water:</b> Loggerhead sea turtles primarily live underwater so they don't necessarily
                            have a set
                            limit as to how much water they should intake.</li>
                        <li><b>Breeding Sites:</b> As mentioned before, loggerhead turtles breed on sandy beaches and
                            this is
                            an example of natal homing where a species returns back to their birthplace to breed and
                            reproduce.</li>
                        <li><b>Food Supply:</b> Loggerhead sea turtles need to live in waters where they have access to
                            crustaceans, fish, seaweed, sargassum, and other marine animals.</li>
                        <li><b>Territory:</b> Loggerhead turtles are found primarily in the Atlantic, Pacific, and
                            Indian
                            Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea.</li>
                        <li><b>Salinity:</b> Loggerhead turtles live only in salt water environments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Loggerhead turtles, as with many other species, have predators and prey. As baby turtles, a few
                        predators include raccoons, ghost crabs, foxes, skunks, etc. When they are grown up, they mainly
                        face predation from sharks and humans. As mentioned previously, loggerhead turtles also prey on
                        other sea creatures for food such as jellyfish, shrimp, fish, sponges, etc. Loggerhead turtles
                        are important in the food chain as they are known as keystone species. Keystone species are
                        species that are crucial in the ecosystem and if they are removed, the ecosystem would change
                        drastically. Loggerhead turtles are important in the ecosystem because they increase the rate of
                        nutrient recycling by breaking up the shells of crustaceans. They also promote diversity around
                        the world in the seam water and are important sources of food for other animals. These turtles
                        help in controlling the population of jellyfish and also maintain the coral reef and its health.

                    <p>Bioaccumulation is the process where living organisms accumulate toxins in their body through the
                        food they consume. In waterways, inorganic mercury is converted to organic methyl-mercury. This
                        organic form of mercury is readily absorbed by plankton, which is then absorbed by other
                        organisms that are included in a Loggerhead turtles diet including crabs, fish, and mollusks
                        which results in the turtles consuming a greater concentration of chemicals. This process is
                        called biomagnification.</p>
                    <p>Both macro and micro plastics are ubiquitously present throughout our oceans. Transported by
                        gyres, high concentrations of plastic shred into microplastics are carried through coastal
                        regions across the North and South Pacific Ocean. Due to the turtles wide variety in diet and
                        inhibition in coastal areas, the Logger back are often susceptible to encountering and ingesting
                        pollutants such as plastic debris and urban area runoff that often impact nearby coasts. These
                        plastics can either be consumed directly or indirectly through bioaccumulation. Directly,
                        plastic ingestion may be mistakenly identified as normal prey such as jellyfish and other small
                        organisms, or caught in their normal dietary items such as macro algae.</p>

                    <p>For loggerhead sea turtles, it is beneficial for the sand on the coast to have a high pH, low
                        nutrient content,
                        and a high concentration of salt. For their water habitat, the ideal pH of the water is between
                        7.4 to 8.0.</p>
                    <h1 id="nutrient-levels">Nutrient Levels:</h1>
                    <p>Nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, are essential in the health of ecosystems and
                        loggerhead turtles.
                        When there is nutrient runoff from the land that accumulates and builds up, this can result in
                        eutrophication.
                        This causes an overgrowth of algae and that results in the depletion of oxygen in the water.
                        This is detrimental
                        to marine life health and the health of loggerhead sea turtles as it will affect their diet and
                        also their

                    <p>There have been studies that heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, accumulate in loggerhead sea
                        turtles'
                        tissues. This is due to the fact that the turtles have longer lifespans and migrate a lot,
                        making them more
                        susceptible to heavy metal exposure.</p>
                    <h1 id="redox--dissolved-oxygen">Redox &rarr; Dissolved Oxygen:</h1>
                    <p>Dissolved oxygen is a measure of how much oxygen has been dissolved in the water and how much
                        oxygen is available
                        to aquatic life. Loggerhead turtles rely on the oxygen in the water to aid in their metabolic
                        processes as well
                        as respiration. You can test the amount of oxygen present in the water by conducting an
                        experiment known as the
                        Winkler method and performing stoichiometric calculations to determine how much dissolved oxygen
                        is present.
                        Oxygen, as mentioned before, is important as lower levels of oxygen can pose difficulties for
                        turtles and affect
                        their well-being.</p>

                    <p>Xenobiotics are compounds that are present in organisms that are not normally found in the
                        habitat. This can
                        include plastic, which is often found in loggerhead turtle habitats. These turtles often ingest
                        the plastic
                        found on the beaches or in the ocean, which poses a great risk for their health. Plastic is a
                        well-known
                        substance that is detrimental to the environment. It is made of additional polymers formed by
                        alkenes. When the
                        alkenes are added together, this creates a long chain of hydrocarbons with functional groups
                        that allow for
                        plastic to have its properties. The hydrocarbon chains result in the difficulty faced by plastic
                        in breaking
                        down as they must also be exposed to higher temperatures and sunlight.</p>
